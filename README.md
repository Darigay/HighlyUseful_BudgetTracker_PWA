## Description:
A Budget Tracking Application gives users a fast important and easy way to track their money, by allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. The offline functionality of thie application is paramount to the success that handles users’ financial information.
This Deployed heroku " budget tracker PWA application " will allow users an offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online.
PWA is a relatively new term in the realm of web development because it is not always necessary to have an application function offline but this one does. By adding the manifest and service worker we have created a full stack application that will function and also add any input that was added offline when the application returns with online. It stores the data in cache and adds it back to the server when it can reconnect again. This assignment showed me a technology that is somewhat new to the full stack web development world and gave me experience working with it. I enjoyed have to develop this application and thought it was probably a good representation of something I might be tasked with in my first real world web development job.
